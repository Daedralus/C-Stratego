Hello and welcome to Stratego!

-The objective of this game is to capture the opponents flag or leave them without units for them to be able to move! 

-The game starts with each player setting up all their tiles in the 10x4 tiles on each side of the river/lakes. Players may not place their units anywhere except their region.

-No unit may enter the water tiles and will be sent back to their previous position as a result.

-Red starts first and each player may only move 1 unit per turn. Units can only move to adjacent tiles and only 1 tile per turn, with the exception of scouts (9) that can travel as many tiles as they want. 

-Bombs and flags cannot move. When units fight the unit with a higher rank wins, with 1 as the highest rank. In the case of a tie, both units die. 

-Marshalls (1) can be killed by spies (S) if attacked, but can kill spies if they attack instead. 

-Bombs can only be defused by miners (8) and will kill all other units. 

Good luck and have fun!
